# Arduino-MIDI

MIDI keyboard made from push buttons using arduino.This project is done using arduino UNO and demo has been done on FL studio (DAW)

This MIDI keyboard has 8 buttons representing notes of a major scale (starting from C4) and can be transposed up and down using extra 2 buttons.
(There is also some info if you want to make proper MIDI with all the keys and knobs in the END)

Requirement for this particular project:-

1) ten push buttons
2) two 10k ohm resistors
3) Jumper wires
4) Arduino Mega or Uno (ATMEGA 328)

# Steps

1) Make the circuit connections either by reffering to the Circuit.png or from https://www.tinkercad.com/things/f6a69geZ6ee-arduino-midi/editel?sharecode=py_GTygFzcwvJVROEEDKGq8sP1jU2249GNyL0IIrgSc

2) After completing the circuit open the "MIDIarduinonomain" folder and then the ino file inside it
